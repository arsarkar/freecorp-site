Dr. Srdjan Nesic is a Russ Professor of Chemical Engineering at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Ohio University in Athens, OH, USA. Since 2002 he also serves as the Director of the Institute for Corrosion and Multiphase Flow Technology at the same university, which is one of the largest research institutions of the kind.

Dr. Nesic has published extensively in the field of corrosion, including 18 articles in books, some of which are reference sections in the best known corrosion handbooks such as: Uhlig's Corrosion Handbook and Shriers's Corrosion, covering corrosion and erosion with applications in the oil and gas industry. He is the author of 136 peer reviewed journal papers, 230 conference papers and 100+ scientific reports in the field of corrosion. His publications have received over 10,000 citations, with articles in the Top 10 Most Cited articles ever published in the CORROSION journal. He is a Fellow of NACE and serves as the Associate Editor of the CORROSION journal by NACE as well as the Corrosion Science Journal by Elsevier.

Dr. Nesic is the recipient of numerous awards and honors such as: Willis Rodney Whitney Award given in recognition of significant contributions to corrosion science by NACE in 2018, the Best Paper award in the CORROSION journal for 2010 and 2015, H.H. Uhlig Award given in recognition of outstanding effectiveness in post-secondary corrosion education from NACE in 2007 and Bengough award for best paper in the British Corrosion Journal in 1998. His graduate students have won the A.B. Campbell award twice, in 2009 and 2015, for the most outstanding manuscript published in the CORROSION journal presented by young authors. He has chaired many sessions at international conferences and has delivered numerous keynote and plenary lectures.

### What you can learn:

* How to use the steady state model in FREECORP™ 2.0 to study the corrosion of mild steel in an aqueous CO2 environment.
* How to set up bulk water chemistry conditions.
* How does various conditions, including different temperatures, solution pH, and water velocities affect the corrosion process?
* How to analyze polarization curves of electrochemical reactions and the predicted corrosion rate.
