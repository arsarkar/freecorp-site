We offer two versions of FREECORP&trade; to download: Installer for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows users and Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for programmers.

## Download Libraries and Sample Interface

The following link provides a ZIP file containing a Visual Studio solution, written in VB.NET. The sample program directory contains a folder called “lib”, which contains the necessary FREECORP&trade; 2.0 DLLs.

Please visit <a href="https://www.icmt.ohio.edu/web/software/public/freecorp2/help/#project-setup">project setup</a> for details of project configurations and APIs used in this sample project. The invocation of library APIs also authenticates the user(s) in the same way the graphical user interface (GUI) of FREECORP&trade; 2.0 does. It is advised to register users using the GUI before using the APIs.
Note: The usage of FREECORP&trade; 2.0 API as an interface to third-party applications is subject to permission as per our terms and agreement. Please <a href="https://www.icmt.ohio.edu/web/software/public/freecorp2/contact/">contact us</a> for any such intent or more information.
